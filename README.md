# Accreo — SPL Wallet Synergy Engine
Rebuild your SPL wallet with synergy algorithms to achieve continuous net-value growth.

## Overview
Accreo is an intelligent synergy engine designed to transform any Solana SPL wallet into a dynamic, self-optimizing micro-portfolio. Instead of treating tokens as isolated assets, Accreo analyzes their relationships, correlations, liquidity conditions, and volatility behaviors to construct a real-time Synergy Matrix—a model that identifies how assets reinforce or weaken each other.

Accreo does not take custody, execute trades, or impose strategies. It simply reveals the most efficient growth path, helping your wallet evolve intelligently through synergy-driven insights.

## Key Features
- **Synergy Matrix Engine**  
  Real-time modeling of SPL asset interactions, correlations, and structural balance.
- **Asset Scoring System**  
  Quantitative scoring based on volatility, liquidity, correlation, and growth potential.
- **Wallet Behavior Mapping**  
  Learns your trading style to generate personalized optimization suggestions.
- **Idle Capital Activation**  
  Identifies under-utilized assets and provides actionable value-unlock recommendations.
- **Structural Risk Guard**  
  Warns of imbalance or unnecessary risk exposure before losses occur.

## Why Accreo?
Most wallets behave like static storage. Accreo transforms yours into an evolving micro-portfolio capable of continuous net-value growth. By unlocking hidden synergy within your SPL assets, Accreo turns wallet management into a structured, data-driven, and intelligent process.
