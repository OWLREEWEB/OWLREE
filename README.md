Owl000 is an on-chain experiment built on Solana.  
Each wallet can adopt a single ASCII owl that is permanently bound to its trading behavior.

This is not a game.  
This is not a collectible.  
This is a mirror.

## What is Owl000?

Owl000 assigns every participating wallet a living counterpart — an ASCII owl.

Your owl observes how you trade on-chain:
- how active you are  
- how patient you are  
- how much risk you take  
- how consistent you remain over time  

These behaviors shape your owl’s form, condition, and survival.

Some owls stabilize and endure.  
Others deteriorate, fracture, or disappear entirely.

Not every owl survives.

## How It Works

### 1. Adopt  
Connect your wallet and adopt one ASCII owl.  
Each wallet can only adopt once.  
Your owl is permanently bound to your address.

### 2. Trade  
Trade as you normally do.  
Your owl watches your on-chain trading behavior.  
No extra actions are required.

### 3. Live or Die  
Your owl evolves over time.  
Trade wisely, and it survives.  
Trade recklessly, and it weakens.  
Survival is not guaranteed.

## What Owl000 Is Not

- Not a profit leaderboard  
- Not financial advice  
- Not a traditional NFT project  
- Not a resettable game  

Owl000 does not judge outcomes.  
It records patterns.

---

## Why ASCII?

ASCII is minimal, transparent, and portable.

Your owl can be:
- displayed on the website
- shared on social media
- embedded in terminals
- copied anywhere as plain text

No images.  
No skins.  
No cosmetics.

Only behavior.

---

## Survival

Owls do not disappear because of a single loss.  
They fade through sustained destructive behavior.

Once gone, an owl cannot be recovered.

Owl000 is an experimental on-chain system.  
It does not provide investment advice or performance evaluation.

Participation is voluntary.

## Status

Owl000 is currently under active development.  
Details may evolve as the system grows.
